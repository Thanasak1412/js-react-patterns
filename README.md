# Design Pattern

A **design pattern** is a reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. It provides a template or blueprint for solving a particular problem, which can be adapted to different situations. Design patterns are commonly used in object-oriented programming to create flexible, maintainable, and reusable software.

There are several categories of design patterns, including:

- **Creational Patterns**: these patterns deal with object creation, providing mechanisms for creating objects in a manner suitable for the situation.
- **Structural Patterns**: these patterns focus on object composition, providing ways to organize objects to form larger structures or systems.
- **Behavioral Patterns**: these patterns deal with object interaction and communication, providing solutions for how objects can communicate and work together.

Some commonly used design patterns include the Singleton pattern, Factory pattern, Adapter pattern, Observer pattern, and Strategy pattern. These patterns have been widely adopted by developers and can be implemented in various programming languages and frameworks.

Design patterns provide a common language and framework for developers to communicate and share solutions to common problems. They help to improve code quality, reduce development time, and create software that is flexible and maintainable.
